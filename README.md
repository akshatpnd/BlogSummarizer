# BlogSummarizer

## Introduction
As someone who has spent a good amount of time during university doing research, I had to go through a lot of blog posts and research papers. Sometimes I wished there was a way to get a quick summary and just move on, and that is exactly what I made during the winter quarter of my senior year. 

## Background
HuggingFace provides various transformers that allow one to provide it with a chunk of text and it provides you with a summary of it. However, the text must be less than 500 words. In order to deal with this, I split the scraped blog into chunks which are then summarized individually before being put together. Finally, a txt document is created with a substantially smaller amount of text to go through.

## Next Steps
Coming back to this project, the only thing that I can think of would be to create a small GUI that would make the UX more streamlined and appealing. Additionally, it would also eliminate the need for the summary to be stored (unless the user wants it to be stored).
